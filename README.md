# Pacific Grove Software Distribution Foundation

## Code of Conduct Overview

This repository contains the Code of Conduct for the Pacific Grove Software Distribution Foundation. It defines the moral and ethical standards expected of all participants in Foundation projects and community spaces. The Code is rooted in ten axioms drawn from scripture and expressed through clear rules, practical applications, and their scriptural foundations.

### Purpose

The Code of Conduct establishes the behavioral expectations for everyone who contributes to or participates in Foundation activities. It applies to code contributions, documentation, discussions, community forums, events, and all Foundation related communication.

Its purpose is to cultivate a community shaped by love, justice, humility, responsibility, and compassion. The Code is not only a set of rules but a way of life that reflects the teachings of Yeshua.

### Reporting

Violations can be reported to Foundation leadership at **[conduct@pgsdf.org](mailto:conduct@pgsdf.org)**. Reports are handled confidentially and retaliation is not permitted.

### Enforcement

The Foundation practices corrective action that follows the spirit of the axioms. Responses prioritize truth, fairness, protection of the community, and restoration whenever possible.

### Leadership Responsibility

Leaders are expected to model the highest standard of these principles, maintain safe spaces for participation, and ensure fair and consistent application of the Code.

### Commitment

By participating in this project, individuals agree to uphold the Code, examine their conduct regularly, and support a community shaped by love, respect, and service.
