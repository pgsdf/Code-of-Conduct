# Pacific Grove Software Distribution Foundation

# Code of Conduct

## Purpose and Scope

This Code of Conduct establishes the moral and ethical foundation for all who participate in the Pacific Grove Software Distribution Foundation. It applies to all Foundation activities, including but not limited to: code contributions, issue discussions, pull requests, documentation, community forums, conferences, and any other Foundation-related communications or gatherings, whether online or in person.

Each principle is derived directly from scripture and presented in three parts:
1. **The Rule** - The standard of conduct expected
2. **Practical Application** - How this applies in our community
3. **Scriptural Foundation** - The sources and axiom text

## Core Principles

### Rule 1. Mutual Care

**Code of Conduct Rule:**  
Members will treat others with the same care, respect, and goodwill they desire for themselves. Every interaction must reflect empathy, consideration, and kindness.

**Practical Application:**
- In code reviews, critique the code, never the person
- Assume good intentions and seek to understand before responding
- Welcome newcomers with patience and helpful guidance
- Respond to questions and requests with the same courtesy you would want
- Consider how your words will be received before speaking or writing
- Acknowledge the time and effort others contribute
- Celebrate the successes of fellow contributors

**Sources:** Matthew 22:37-40, Mark 12:29-31, Gospel of Thomas saying 25  
**Axiom Text:**  
*Love your neighbor as yourself means "Do unto others as you wish others to do unto you." Nothing is greater than this.*

---

### Rule 2. Non-Harm

**Code of Conduct Rule:**  
Members will refrain from causing harm through actions, words, negligence, or intent. All conduct must align with love and avoid injury to others or oneself.

*Sin is the violation of love, the doing of harm to others or yourself. To love is to do no harm.*

---

### Rule 3. Humble Repentance

**Code of Conduct Rule:**  
Members will acknowledge wrongdoing, seek reconciliation, and demonstrate sincere change. Confession and correction are encouraged, not punished.

**Practical Application:**
- When you make a mistake, own it promptly and clearly
- Apologize sincerely when your actions cause harm
- Accept correction gracefully and implement suggested improvements
- Learn from errors rather than defending them
- Support others who acknowledge their mistakes

*God's love is unconditional and He forgives all who repent with a humble heart.*

---

### Rule 4. Forgiveness and Non-Judgment

**Code of Conduct Rule:**  
Members will practice forgiveness and avoid condemnation. Conflicts must be approached with fairness, patience, and a willingness to release others from judgment.

**Practical Application:**

## Reporting Violations

### How to Report

If you experience or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Direct Resolution** (when safe and appropriate): Consider speaking directly with the person involved, assuming good intent and seeking understanding.

2. **Report to Leadership**: Contact Foundation leadership at [conduct@pgsdf.org] with:
   - Description of what occurred
   - When and where it happened
   - Any relevant screenshots, logs, or documentation
   - Names of witnesses (if any)
   - How you would like to see it resolved

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. Details will only be shared with those necessary to investigate and resolve the situation.

### No Retaliation

Retaliation against anyone who reports a violation or participates in an investigation is itself a serious violation and will be addressed accordingly.

---

## Enforcement

The Foundation enforces this Code of Conduct with a commitment to restoration, justice, and community protection. Enforcement follows the principles of the axioms themselves: truth, humility, and compassion balanced with accountability.

### Response Process

1. **Investigation**: Leadership will gather facts from all parties involved
2. **Discernment**: The situation will be evaluated in light of these principles

### Corrective Actions

Responses may include, but are not limited to:

- **Temporary Restrictions**: Limited participation in certain activities or channels
- **Probation**: Monitored participation for a defined period

### Restoration Focus

Following the axiom of repentance and forgiveness, the Foundation prioritizes restoration when:
- The person acknowledges wrongdoing
- Sincere apology is offered to affected parties
- Concrete steps toward change are demonstrated
- Affected parties feel safe with re-integration

### Serious Violations

Some violations require immediate action to protect the community:
- Threats of violence or actual violence

In these cases, removal may occur without progressive discipline.

### Appeals

Decisions may be appealed to Foundation leadership within 14 days by:

## Leadership Responsibilities

Foundation leaders are held to the highest standard of these principles and are responsible for:

- Modeling the behavior expected of all members
- Addressing violations fairly, promptly, and consistently
- Maintaining confidentiality of reports and investigations
- Creating spaces where all can contribute safely
